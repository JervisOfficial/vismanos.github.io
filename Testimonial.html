        <h1>My ICT Journey</h1>
        <div id="context">
                <article>During the orientation on digital citizenship, I was amazed by the speaker and staff of NBSC, especially the computer program. I was excited to know the outcomes of the training, and while we listened to the speakers, I was motivated to know more about digital and the benefits to me and my community.</article>

                <article>At the first session of training, I was able to learn the types of PC. There is a PC desktop, laptop, and smartphone. PC Desktop is a computer set that we used for training, and I was able to know the parts. Also, I was able to know the essential parts, which are simple and complex.</article>
                <article>♥</article>
                <article>The second session of training, I was able to learn the difference between hardware and software. Hardware is any element of the computer that is physically seen and touched, while software is anything that tells the hardware what to do. So, I know what the hardware capabilities are and what software we are using to manipulate data.</article>

                <article>In the third-to-fifth session of training, I was able to gain more ideas about the spreadsheet software. I was amazed at how a spreadsheet works to ease the task of an individual. I was delighted to know the formulas, functions, toolbars, charts, and other icons that we used in the spreadsheet. Spreadsheets are essential for teachers like me to manipulate and organize the data easily. For example, to make a grading system, I can do it with a spreadsheet.</article>
                <article>♥</article>
                <article>In the sixth to ninth sessions of training, I was able to gain more ideas about the presentation software. In the teaching field, presentation software is essential and can make teaching more organized. I was amazed that the presentation slide layout can be easily customized with the slide master. Slide master is more convenient to create presentations with ease, so layouting another slide won’t bother you anymore. Transitions and animations can make the presentation more engaging and, at the same time, motivating for the students and the viewers. Also, I can input other elements in the slides, like pictures, videos, audios, and others.</article>

                <article>In the tenth session up to this point, web development is new to my experience. I was able to create a simple web page in this program I’m in. I was able to insert some important codes by copying from a file, but it’s okay. We humans find ways to enhance the learning. Codes are essential to creating a website, and to become more advanced, one must learn a lot of books, articles, and/or trainings.</article>
                <article>♥</article>
                <article>Overall, the learning I gain in this program is new and fun to learn new things. I am thankful for the opportunity that I received, and this learning is my armor for the battlefield.</article>
